## Introduction

My name is Aidan Coffey and I am from Long Island, NY. I am a 4th in the College majoring in Political Science and Public Policy. (*BA Spring 2020*). 

## Politcal Science Background

At UChicago, I have focused my study on American politics. I have supplanted that academic focus while organizing for the Missouri Democratic Party. I recommend you check out their website here! <https://missouridemocrats.org/>

At the MO-DP, I..
* knocked at least 100 doors a day
* scheduled voluteers in the community to knock doors, make calls, and participate in our democracy
* co-ran a team of interns of over 15 high school students
* Worked 6 days a week from 8am-9pm!

## Extracurricular Activities 

I have sang in **Run for Cover**, our on-campus acappella group, for the past four years at uchicago! I will deeply miss being a part of the group. Here is a link to our spotify, check us out. <https://open.spotify.com/artist/1WN22dBwn6fM3biZufox5W>

## Conclusion

Thanks so much for reading!
